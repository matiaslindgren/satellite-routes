# satellite-routes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matiaslindgren/satellite-routes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matiaslindgren/satellite-routes)

This project started as a debugging tool for validating my solutions to the [Reaktor Orbital Challenge](https://reaktor.com/orbital-challenge). The backend is written in Clojure on Luminus, a Leiningen template. The frontend is built on HTML5 Boilerplate generated from [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) with some styling from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The JavaScript graphics are implemented with [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/) with textures from [NASA](http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/).

The main purpose of this app is to serve as some kind of portfolio material. It should be noted that I haven't studied geomatics engineering or similar sciences so there might be many inaccuracies with how geographic positions are mapped to the graphical representation of the Earth.

Currently deployed to [Heroku](http://satellite-thing.herokuapp.com/)


## TODO

- Strip all unneeded dependencies and redundancies from the project
- Implement sensible random parameter generators for tests
- Make tests for JavaScript?
- Generate documentation with codox and host on github.io
