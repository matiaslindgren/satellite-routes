    <p>When this URI is accessed with an AJAX request, the server generates a graph with satellites in (pseudo) random locations, dispersed over earth at altitudes between 300 and 700 km. The graph is presented as a hashmap and sent from the server to the frontend in JSON format.
    Below is a satellite graph generated by the server. The data representation has been prettified compared to the raw JSON string.</p>
    <p>Refreshing this page triggers the generation of a new dataset.
    The amount of generated satellites can be controlled by appending a query to the URL, for example generate?satelliteCount=100. If no query is given, the satellite count defaults to 20</p>

  <h4>Nodes</h4>
  <p>Nodes are given as hashmaps, with the keys <code>:name</code> and <code>:pos</code>.
     The position is a vector with the values <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, where the origin is at the center of the earth. Below are the nodes in raw format.</p>
  {% for node in nodes %}
    <code>{{ node }}</code><br>
  {% endfor %}

  <br>

  <h4>Edges</h4>
  <p>Edges are given as vectors, where indexes 0 and 1 contain the nodes which are connected and index 2 contains the float value corresponding to the distance between these nodes measured in kilometers. Index 3 is an object containing only one key :is_solution_path, which maps to true if the corresponding edge is part of the shortest path between nodes named "START" and "END", else false. Below is the first edge in raw format and a table of all edges. </p>
  <code>{{ edges.0 }}</code>
