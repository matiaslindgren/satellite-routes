<p>You accessed manually the /generate page. 
This route is intended for AJAX requests from the frontend for loading the generated data from the server as JSON for drawing.
Below is the (pseudo) random satellite graph generated by the server.</p>
<p>You can refresh the page to trigger generation of a new dataset.
The generation is also triggered by pressing the load satellite data button on the home page, but then the data is returned as a JSON response.</p>
